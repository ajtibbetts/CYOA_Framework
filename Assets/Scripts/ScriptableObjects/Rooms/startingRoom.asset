  description: "<align=\"center\">\n<b><u><size=150%>Chapter 1</size></u></b>\n<i><size=110%>Humble
    Beginnings</size></i></align>\n\n\tMany years ago there was an person named {p.playerName}
    so exceedingly fond of new clothes that he spent all his money on being well
    dressed. He cared nothing about reviewing his soldiers, going to the theatre,
    or going for a ride in his carriage, except to show off his new clothes. He had
    a coat for every hour of the day, and instead of saying, as one might, about
    any other ruler, \"The King's in council,\" here they always said. \"The Emperor's
    in his dressing room.\"\n\n\nIn the great city where he lived, life was always
    gay. Every day many strangers came to town, and among them one day came two swindlers.
    They let it be known they were weavers, and they said they could weave the most
    magnificent fabrics imaginable. Not only were their colors and patterns uncommonly
    fine, but clothes made of this cloth had a wonderful way of becoming invisible
    to anyone who was unfit for his office, or who was unusually stupid.\n\n\n\"Those
    would be just the clothes for me,\" thought the Emperor. \"If I wore them I would
    be able to discover which men in my empire are unfit for their posts. And I could
    tell the wise men from the fools. Yes, I certainly must get some of the stuff
    woven for me right away.\" He paid the two swindlers a large sum of money to
    start work at once."
