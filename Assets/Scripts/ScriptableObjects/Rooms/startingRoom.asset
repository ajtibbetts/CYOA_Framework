  description: 'Many years ago there was an Emperor so exceedingly fond of new clothes
    that he spent all his money on being well dressed. He cared nothing about reviewing
    his soldiers, going to the theatre, or going for a ride in his carriage, except
    to show off his new clothes. He had a coat for every hour of the day, and instead
    of saying, as one might, about any other ruler, "The King''s in council," here
    they always said. "The Emperor''s in his dressing room."



    In the great
    city where he lived, life was always gay. Every day many strangers came to town,
    and among them one day came two swindlers. They let it be known they were weavers,
    and they said they could weave the most magnificent fabrics imaginable. Not only
    were their colors and patterns uncommonly fine, but clothes made of this cloth
    had a wonderful way of becoming invisible to anyone who was unfit for his office,
    or who was unusually stupid.



    "Those would be just the clothes for me,"
    thought the Emperor. "If I wore them I would be able to discover which men in
    my empire are unfit for their posts. And I could tell the wise men from the fools.
    Yes, I certainly must get some of the stuff woven for me right away." He paid
    the two swindlers a large sum of money to start work at once.'
