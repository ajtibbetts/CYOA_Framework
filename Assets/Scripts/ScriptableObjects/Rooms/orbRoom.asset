  description: 'They set up two looms and pretended to weave, though there was nothing
    on the looms. All the finest silk and the purest old thread which they demanded
    went into their traveling bags, while they worked the empty looms far into the
    night.

    

    "I''d like to know how those weavers are getting on with
    the cloth," the Emperor thought, but he felt slightly uncomfortable when he remembered
    that those who were unfit for their position would not be able to see the fabric.
    It couldn''t have been that he doubted himself, yet he thought he''d rather send
    someone else to see how things were going. The whole town knew about the cloth''s
    peculiar power, and all were impatient to find out how stupid their neighbors
    were.

    

    "I''ll send my honest old minister to the weavers," the Emperor
    decided. "He''ll be the best one to tell me how the material looks, for he''s
    a sensible man and no one does his duty better."

    

    So the honest old
    minister went to the room where the two swindlers sat working away at their empty
    looms.'
